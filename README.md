# MLD, Multicast Listener Discovery

(Source-Specific Multicast)

Multicast enable it to resolve these address of not only a single host, but also a group of hosts.

Instead of using Broadcast, which forces all the node in subnet to handle it address question.

And Multicast makes a single group of hosts to handle its datagram, in this way, save memory and cpu resource of other unrelated node to bypass this address resolution question.
